# 👋 Hey, I'm Jonas Pains  
High school student from **New Jersey (Class of 2026)**. Programmer, builder, and lowkey obsessed with robots.  
I spend way too much time debugging, designing, and making stuff that probably shouldn’t work but somehow *does*.  

---

### 🤖 Robotics & Tech Stuff
Currently with **[FRC Team 1811 FRESH](https://frc1811.com)**; I’m the **Programming Captain**, building code that brings our robot (*Narwhal*) to life for the 2025 **REEFSCAPE** season.  
I like turning wild ideas into working code and seeing them move IRL.

### 🧠 Skills & Tools
- **Languages:** Python 🐍, JavaScript ⚡, Java ☕  
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Node.js, Express.js, Git, VS Code, PyCharm, JetBrains Fleet, WebStorm
